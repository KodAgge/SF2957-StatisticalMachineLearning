# SF2957-Project-2

This project consisted of training agent to play Blackjack using reinforcement learning. Two different state spaces were used, _the expanded state space_ and _the sum state space_. The following methods were used:

1. On-policy Monte-Carlo learning
    * _Expanded state space_
2. Q-learning
    * _Expanded state space_
    * _Sum state space_

The optimal strategy that was found was very similar to the optimal strategy. The differences most likely comes from us training on a simplified game (e.g. no _splitting pairs_) and because more training was needed.
